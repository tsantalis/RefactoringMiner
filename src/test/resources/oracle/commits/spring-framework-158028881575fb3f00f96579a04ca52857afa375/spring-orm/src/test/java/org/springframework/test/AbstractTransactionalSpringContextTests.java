/**
 * This class is only used within tests in the spring-orm module.
 *
 * <p>Convenient base class for JUnit 3.8 based tests that should occur in a
 * transaction, but normally will roll the transaction back on the completion of
 * each test.
 *
 * <p>This is useful in a range of circumstances, allowing the following benefits:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Ability to delete or insert any data in the database, without affecting
 * other tests
 * <li>Providing a transactional context for any code requiring a transaction
 * <li>Ability to write anything to the database without any need to clean up.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class is typically very fast, compared to traditional setup/teardown
 * scripts.
 *
 * <p>If data should be left in the database, call the {@link #setComplete()}
 * method in each test. The {@link #setDefaultRollback "defaultRollback"}
 * property, which defaults to "true", determines whether transactions will
 * complete by default.
 *
 * <p>It is even possible to end the transaction early; for example, to verify lazy
 * loading behavior of an O/R mapping tool. (This is a valuable away to avoid
 * unexpected errors when testing a web UI, for example.) Simply call the
 * {@link #endTransaction()} method. Execution will then occur without a
 * transactional context.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #startNewTransaction()} method may be called after a call to
 * {@link #endTransaction()} if you wish to create a new transaction, quite
 * independent of the old transaction. The new transaction's default fate will
 * be to roll back, unless {@link #setComplete()} is called again during the
 * scope of the new transaction. Any number of transactions may be created and
 * ended in this way. The final transaction will automatically be rolled back
 * when the test case is torn down.
 *
 * <p>Transactional behavior requires a single bean in the context implementing the
 * {@link PlatformTransactionManager} interface. This will be set by the
 * superclass's Dependency Injection mechanism. If using the superclass's Field
 * Injection mechanism, the implementation should be named "transactionManager".
 * This mechanism allows the use of the
 * {@link AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTests} superclass even when
 * there is more than one transaction manager in the context.
 *
 * <p><b>This base class can also be used without transaction management, if no
 * PlatformTransactionManager bean is found in the context provided.</b> Be
 * careful about using this mode, as it allows the potential to permanently
 * modify data. This mode is available only if dependency checking is turned off
 * in the {@link AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTests} superclass. The
 * non-transactional capability is provided to enable use of the same subclass
 * in different environments.
