/**
 * Implements importing from other plugins. <br>
 * <br>
 * How punishment data is stored differs across plugins, especially with regards to UUIDs
 * and names. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>AdvancedBan</b> <br>
 * AdvancedBan has no dedicated persistent UUID/name cache. The plugin does store victim names
 * and UUIDs alongside each punishment. Also, it does not retain the operator UUID, but rather
 * uses operator names. This requires a lookup during the import process. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>LiteBans</b> <br>
 * LiteBans maintains a UUID and name store in litebans_history.
 * Additionally, it puts the victim name and UUID, and the operator name and UUID,
 * alongside each punishment.
