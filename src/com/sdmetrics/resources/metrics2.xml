<!-- class metrics -->
<!-- class size -->

<metric name="NumAttr" domain="class" category="Size">
<description>The number of attributes in the class.((p))

The metric counts all properties regardless of their type (data type,
class or interface), visibility, changeability (read only or not), and
owner scope (class-scope, i.e. static, or instance
attribute).((p))
Not counted are inherited properties, and properties that are members
of an association, i.e., that represent navigable association ends.
((ul))((li))Also known as: NV (Number of Variables per class) ref://LK94/.((/ul))

</description>
<projection relset="ownedattributes" target="property" condition="association=''"/>
</metric>

<metric name="NumOps" domain="class" category="Size">
<description>The number of operations in a class.((p))
Includes all operations in the class that are explicitly modeled
(overriding operations, constructors, destructors), regardless
of their visibility, owner scope (class-scope, i.e., static),
or whether they are abstract or not. Inherited operations are
not counted.
((ul))
((li))Also known as: WMC (Weighted method complexity) where each operation is
assigned unity complexity ref://CK94/.
((li))Also known as: NM (Number of Methods) ref://LK94/.
((/ul))
</description>
<projection relset="ownedoperations" />
</metric>

<metric name="NumPubOps" domain="class" category="Size">
<description>The number of public operations in a class.((p))
Same as metric metric://class/NumOps/, but only counts operations with
public visibility. Measures the size of the class in terms
of its public interface.
((ul))((li))Also known as: NPM (Number of Public Methods)
ref://LK94/.((/ul))
</description>

<projection relset="ownedoperations" condition="visibility='public'"/>

</metric>

<metric name="Setters" domain="class" category="Size">
<description>The number of operations with a name starting with 'set'.((p))
Note that this metric does not always yield accurate results. For example, an
operation ((code))settleAccount((/code)) will be counted as setter method.
((ul))((li))See also: metric://class/Getters/.((/ul))
</description>
<projection relset="ownedoperations" condition="name startswith 'set'" />
</metric>

<metric name="Getters" domain="class" category="Size">
<description>The number of operations with a name starting with 'get', 'is', or
'has'.((p))
Note that this metric does not always yield accurate results. For example, an
operation ((code))isolateNode((/code)) will be counted as getter method.
((ul))((li))See also: metric://class/Setters/.((/ul))
</description>
<projection relset="ownedoperations" sum="GetterName" />
</metric>

<!-- class nesting structure -->
<metric name="Nesting" domain="class">
<description>The nesting level of the class (for inner classes).((p))
Measures how deeply a class is nested within other classes.
Classes not defined in the context of another class have nesting level 0,
their inner classes have nesting level 1, etc.
Nesting levels deeper than 1 are unusual; an excessive nesting structure
is difficult to understand, and should be revised.
</description>
<nesting relation="context" />
</metric>


<!-- class inheritance -->
<metric name="IFImpl" domain="class" category="Inheritance">
<description>The number of interfaces the class implements.((p))
This only counts direct interface realization links from the class to the interface.
For example, if a class ((i))C((/i)) implements an interface ((i))I((/i)),
which extends some other interfaces, only interface ((i))I((/i))
will be counted, but not the interfaces that ((i))I((/i)) extends
(even though class ((i))c((/i)) implements those interfaces, too).</description>
<compoundmetric term="size(ProvidedIF)" />
</metric>

<metric name="NOC" domain="class" category="Inheritance">
<description>The number of children of the class (UML Generalization).((p))
Similar to glossary://Coupling (export)/export coupling/, NOC indicates the potential
influence a class has on the design.
If a class has a large number of children, it may require more testing of the
methods in that class. A large number of child classes may indicate improper
abstraction of the parent class.

<projection relation="general" target="generalization" element="context" />
</metric>

<metric name="NumDesc" domain="class" category="Inheritance">
<description>The number of descendents of the class (UML Generalization).((p))
Counts the number of children of the class, their children, and so on.

</metric>

<metric name="NumAnc" domain="class" category="Inheritance">
<description>The number of ancestors of the class.((p))
Counts the number of parents of the class, their parents, and so on.
If multiple inheritance is not used, the metric yields the same
values as metric://class/DIT/.
((ul))((li))Suggested in ref://LC94/ and ref://TSM92/.((/ul))
</description>
<compoundmetric term="size(AncSet)" />
</metric>

<metric name="DIT" domain="class" category="Inheritance">
<description>The depth of the class in the inheritance hierarchy.((p))
This is calculated as the longest path from the class to the root of
the inheritance tree. The DIT for a class that has no parents is 0.((p))
Classes with high DIT inherit from many classes and thus are more
difficult to understand. Also, classes with high DIT may not be proper
specializations of all of their ancestor classes.

<metric name="NumAssEl_ssc" domain="class" category="Coupling">
<description>The number of associated elements in the same scope (namespace)
as the class.((p))
For instance, for a class that is defined in a package ((i))p((/i)),
this counts only associations with classes, interfaces, etc.
in the same package ((i))p((/i)). Such associations are encouraged,
because they do not cross the package boundary, and contribute to the cohesion
of the package.((p))
This metric does not distinguish plain, aggregate, or composite associations,
as well as incoming, outgoing, or bidirectional associations; all such
associations are counted.
</description>
<projection relset="AssElSet" scope="same" />
</metric>

<metric name="NumAssEl_sb" domain="class" category="Coupling">
<description>The number of associated elements in the same scope branch as the
class.((p))
For instance, for a class that is defined in a package ((i))p((/i)),
this metric only counts associations with model elements((ul))
((li))in ((i))p((/i)) itself,
((li))in packages that ((i))p((/i)) contains (subpackages, sub-subpackages
etc. of ((i))p((/i))),
((li))in packages that contain ((i))p((/i)) (packages of which ((i))p((/i))
is a subpackage, sub-subpackage etc).
((/ul))
Such associations cross package boundaries, but one of the packages is nested
within the other. Therefore, a dependency between the packages is expected,
anyway.
((ul))((li))Note: Like metric metric://class/NumAssEl_ssc/, direction and
aggregation of the associations are ignored.((/ul))

</metric>

<metric name="NumAssEl_nsb" domain="class" category="Coupling">
<description>The number of associated elements not in the same scope branch as
the class.((p))
For a class that is defined in a package ((i))p((/i)),
this counts only associations with model elements in packages that neither
contain ((i))p((/i)) nor are contained by ((i))p((/i)).
These are the least desirable associations, because they couple otherwise
unrelated packages. Such associations cannot be avoided, but their use should
be minimized.

aggregation of the associations are ignored.((/ul))

implement the interface via a descendent. Together with metric
metric://interface/NumDirClients/, this indicates the total number of
realizations of the interface.

<metric name="D" domain="package">
<description>Distance from the main sequence.

Package design should aim to strike a balance between instability and abstractness
of the packages. A stable package should be abstract, so that changes to the
package are merely extensions that do not affect existing clients of the package.
An instable package is easy to change and can therefore be concrete.((p))

The Stable-Abstractions-Principle (SAP) says that a package should be as abstract
as it is stable. With abstractness measured by metric metric://package/A/, and stability
measured by metric metric://package/I/, the SAP demands that A+I be close to 1.((p))

If you plot A vs. I in a graph, the "main sequence" is the theoretical optimal line
where A+I=1. Metric D is the distance of the package from the main sequence, and is
calculated as (A+I-1)*sqrt(2).((p))

Values range from -sqrt(2) to +sqrt(2). Values close to zero indicate packages
that adhere to the SAP. A large negative value indicates a package
that is concrete and stable (A and I close to 0). Such a package can be
"painful" because it is not extensible and prone to change.
A large positive value indicates a package that is abstract and instable. Such a
package is extensible but has few dependents, and is therefore useless.

<!--- The Glossary -->

<term name="Cohesion">
Cohesion is the degree to which the elements in a design unit
(package, class) are logically related, or "belong together". As
such, cohesion is a semantic concept.((p))

Cohesion metrics have been proposed which attempt to approximate this
semantic concept using syntactical criteria. Such metrics quantify the
connectivity (coupling) between elements of the design unit: the
higher the connectivity between elements, the higher the cohesion.((p))

Cohesion metrics often are normalized to have a notion of minimum and
maximum cohesion, usually expressed on a scale from 0 to 1. Minimum
cohesion (0) is assumed when the elements are entirely unconnected,
maximum cohesion (1) is assumed when each element is connected to
every other element.((p))

Not normalized metrics are based on counts of connections between
design elements in a unit (e.g., method calls within a class). As
such, not normalized metrics are conceptually similar to
glossary://Complexity/complexity/ metrics.((p))

((i))Impact on quality((/i))((p))

A low cohesive design element has been assigned many unrelated
responsibilities. Consequently, the design element is more difficult
to understand and therefore also harder to maintain and reuse. Design
elements with low cohesion should be considered for refactoring, for
instance, by extracting parts of the functionality to separate classes
with clearly defined responsibilities.((p))

((i))Empirical results((/i)) ref://BW02/((p))

In practice, cohesion metrics are only of limited usefulness:
((ul))
((li))Not normalized cohesion metrics often are strongly related to size
metrics. This makes sense since, as discussed in the section on
glossary://Size/size/
metrics, large classes or packages may in fact suffer from low
cohesion. Such cohesion metrics then are, of course, good quality
indicators, but they are redundant with size metrics - they
provide no new information about the element.
((li))Normalized cohesion metrics do not consistently have a bearing on
system qualities. I.e., we cannot conclude from a high or low cohesion
value that a class is, e.g., more or less fault-prone. Either, the
theoretical negative impact of low cohesion on system quality is not
always that critical in practice, or, the cohesion metrics simply fail
to identify design elements with unrelated responsibilities.
((/ul))
</term>
<term name="Completeness">Design rules of the "Completeness" category raise
issues that hint at incomplete design. This highlights model elements that still
need some work. For example, empty packages, unused classes, unnamed attributes,
parameters without a type, etc.</term>
<term name="Complexity">
Complexity measures the degree of connectivity between elements of a
design unit. Whereas glossary://Size/size/ counts the elements in a design unit,
complexity is concerned with the relationships/dependencies between
the elements in the design unit. For instance, counting the number
method invocations among the methods within one class can be
considered a measure of class complexity, or the number of transitions
between the states in a state diagram.((p))

((i))Impact on quality((/i))((p))

High complexity of interactions between the elements of a design unit
can lead to decreased understandability and therefore increased
fault-proneness. Also, testing such design units is more difficult.((p))

((i))Empirical results((/i)) ref://BW02/((p))

In practice, complexity metrics are often strongly correlated with
size measures. Large design units that contain many design elements
within are also more likely to have a large number of connections
between the design elements.((p))

Thus, while complexity metrics are good indicators of qualities such
as fault-proneness, they provide no new insights in addition to size
metrics.
</term>
<term name="Correctness">Design rules of the "Correctness" category raise issues
that constitute illegal design. For example, violation of well-formedness rules
(glossary://WFR//) of the UML.</term>
<term name="Coupling">
The degree to which the elements in a design are connected.((p))

((i))Impact on quality((/i))((p))

Coupling connections cause dependencies between design elements, which,
in turn, have an impact on system qualities such as maintainability (a
modification of a design element may require modifications to its connected
elements) or testability (a fault in one design element may cause a failure
in a completely different, connected element). Thus, a common design principle
is to minimize coupling.((p))

Most coupling dependencies are directed - the coupling usually defines a
client-supplier relationship between the design elements. Therefore, it is
useful to distinguish import coupling ("using") and export coupling ("used"):
((ul))((li))See glossary://Coupling (import)// and
glossary://Coupling (export)//.((/ul))

((i))Empirical results((/i)) ref://BW02/((p))

Coupling metrics have consistently been found to be good indicators of
fault-proneness. It seems worthwhile to investigate different dimensions
of coupling: import and export coupling, different coupling mechanisms,
distinguishing coupling to COTS libraries and application-specific
classes/packages. Coupling metrics are suitable to identify design
elements with high fault density. Therefore, coupling metrics greatly
help to identify small parts of a design that contain a large number of faults.

</term>
<term name="Coupling (import)">
Import coupling measures the degree to which an element has knowledge
of, uses, or depends on other design elements.((p))

((i))Impact on quality((/i))

((ul))
((li))Decreased maintainability: changes to the supplier may necessitate
follow-up changes (ripple effects) to the client. The stability of the supplier
is a factor to consider here. High coupling to elements that are not likely to
change is less harmful than coupling to variation points.
((li))Decreased understandability, increased fault-proneness: elements with high
import coupling operate in large context, developers need to know all the services
the element relies on, and how to use them.
((li))Decreased reusability: To reuse a class or package with high import coupling
in a new context, all the required services must also be made available in the
new context.
((/ul))

((i))Empirical results((/i))((p))
See entry for glossary://Coupling/coupling/.
</term>
<term name="Coupling (export)">Export coupling measures the degree to which an
element is used by, depended upon, by other design elements. High export coupling
is often observed for general utility classes (e.g., for string handling or
logging services) that are used pervasively across all layers of the system.
Thus, high export coupling is not necessarily indicative of bad design.((p))

((i))Impact on quality((/i))((p))

High export coupling
elements that are likely to change in the future can have a large impact on the
system if the change affects the interface. Therefore, high export classes
should be reviewed for anticipated changes, to ensure that these changes can
implemented with minimal impact.((p))

((i))Empirical results((/i))((p))
See entry for glossary://Coupling/coupling/.
</term>
<term name="Diagram">
Diagram metrics pertain to the diagrams of the UML model.
There are two types of diagram metrics:
((ol))
((li))Diagram metrics that count how often a class, package, etc. appears
on the diagrams in the model. Similar to
glossary://Coupling (export)/export coupling/, the more often a model element
appears on diagrams, the more important is the role of the model element.((br))
You may also look out for elements which do not appear on any diagrams.
This could indicate that the diagrams are not complete, or they may be
the result of an incomplete delete operation.
((li))Metrics that count the number of model elements on a diagram.
These measure the size of the diagram. You may consider reorganizing
large diagrams into several smaller ones, e.g., based on the 7 +/-2 rule
of the amount of information that people can deal with at a time ref://Amb03/.
((/ol))
On a technical note, many UML modeling tools use a proprietary solution to
store diagram layout information in the XMI file. If you do not obtain
diagram metrics for your model, you need a special XMI transformation file.
Check the SDMetrics website if there is one available for your UML tool.
</term>
<term name="Inheritance">
Inheritance-related metrics are concerned with the use of inheritance
relationships. This includes aspects such as
((ul))
((li))depth/width of the inheritance graph
((li))number of ancestors/descendents of a design element
((li))inherited size
((li))polymorphism, method overriding, etc.
((/ul))

((i))Impact on quality((/i))((p))

Deep inheritance structures are hypothesized to be more fault-prone.
The information needed to fully understand a class situated deep in the
inheritance tree is spread over several ancestor classes, thus more difficult
to overview.((p))

Similar to high export coupling, a modification to a design element with a
large number of descendents can have a large effect on the system. Make sure
the interface of the class is stable, or that anticipated modifications can be
added without affecting the inheritance hierarchy at large.((p))

((i))Empirical results((/i)) ref://BW02/((p))

Empirical studies show that effects of the use of inheritance on system qualities
such as fault-proneness vary greatly. Depending on factors such as developer
experience, system quality can benefit or suffer from the use of inheritance,
or be unaffected by it.((p))

Thus, inheritance metrics should not be relied on for decision making before
their impact on system quality is not demonstrated in a given development
environment. Extant inheritance metrics per se are not suitable to distinguish
proper use of inheritance from improper use.((p))

Also, inheritance is not very frequently used in designs. Typically,
only a small percentage of the classes in a system will participate
in inheritance relationships. As a consequence, inheritance-related
metrics tend to have low variance. Such metrics do not differentiate
design elements very well and therefore are less likely to be useful
quality predictors.
</term>
<term name="Naming">Design rules of the "Naming" category raise issues concerning
the names assigned to model elements. For example, adherence to naming conventions
for capitalization, use of keywords in element names.
</term>
<term name="Severity">The severity of a design rule indicates how critical a
violation is. The rules distinguish three levels of severity:
((ul))
((li))1-high - violation of the rule constitutes illegal design, or poor
design practices with a strong negative impact on system quality.
The issue should be resolved under all circumstances.
((li))2-med - violation of the rule may negatively impact system quality.
The issue should be resolved if there is no justification for the violation.
((li))3-low - violation of the rule is not likely to have severe consequences,
but perfectionists will still want to address the issue.
((/ul))
</term>
<term name="Size">
Design size metrics measure the size of design elements, typically by counting
the elements contained within. For example, the number of operations in a class,
the number of classes in a package, and so on.((p))

((i))Impact on quality((/i))

Size metrics are good candidates for developing cost or effort estimates for
implementation, review, testing, or maintenance activities. Such estimates are
then used as input for project planning purposes and the allocation of personnel.((p))

In addition, large sized design elements (e.g., big classes or packages) may suffer
from poor design. In an iterative development process, more and more functionality
is added to a class or package over time. The danger is that, eventually, many
unrelated responsibilities are assigned to a design element. As a result, it has
low functional glossary://Cohesion/cohesion/. This in turn negatively impacts the
understandability, reusability, and maintainability of the design element.((p))

Therefore, interfaces and implementations of large classes or packages should be
reviewed for functional cohesion. If there is no justification for the large size,
the design element should be considered for refactoring, for instance, extract parts
of the functionality to separate, more cohesive classes.((p))

((i))Empirical results((/i)) ref://BW02/((p))

Empirical studies consistently confirm the importance of size as the main cost
driver in a software project. Size metrics are also consistently good indicators
of fault-proneness: large methods/classes/packages contain more faults. However,
since size metrics systematically identify large design elements as fault-prone,
these metrics alone are not suitable to find elements with high fault density
</term>
<term name="Style">Design rules of the "Style" category raise design issues that
are considered bad practice. While these issues do not indicate illegal design,
they may be detrimental to system quality in the long run. For example,
circular dependencies among packages, a class referencing one of its subclasses,
long parameter lists, etc.</term>
<term name="WFR">Well-formedness rules. The UML standards ref://OMG03/
